## Problem Statement
This is the future of E-Commerce in Kenya. Unlike the normal E-Commerce sites this site is tailor made for farmers and their farm produce. It gives a platform to all kinds of farmers to easily access their customers and widen their market. The farmers need to create log-in credentials, once that is done an online portfolio is made. In the portfolio, they can add more products/goods and edit what they already posted.
Customers can view all the goods posted on the site without having to log-in.
